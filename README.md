# monkeyc-optimizer README

This module is a set of utilities for optimizing Garmin Monkey-C code. Its the engine behind [prettier-extension-monkeyc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=markw65.prettier-extension-monkeyc). Its not currently expected to be useful outside of that context but may be extended in future to make it useful in complex projects beyond the scope of that extension.

## Release Notes
